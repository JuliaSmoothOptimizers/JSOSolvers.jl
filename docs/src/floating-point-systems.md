# Solvers

The following example also illustrates that the solvers are compatible with most data structures supported by Julia by running the solver TRUNK on GPUs.
We use here ExaModels.jl [@shin2024accelerating] to model an optimization problem as it implements the NLPModel API and is compatible with GPU backends.

```julia
using CUDA, ExaModels, JSOSolvers, NLPModels, OptimizationProblems
problem = "woods"
nscal = 100
model = OptimizationProblems.PureJuMP.eval(Meta.parse(problem))(n = nscal)
nlp_gpu = ExaModels.ExaModel(model; backend=CUDABackend(), prod=true)
stats = trunk(nlp_gpu)
```
