## Linting and formatting

Install a plugin on your editor to use [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org).
This will ensure that your editor is configured with important formatting settings.

We use [https://pre-commit.com](https://pre-commit.com) to run the linters and formatters.
In particular, the Julia code is formatted using [JuliaFormatter.jl](https://github.com/domluna/JuliaFormatter.jl), so please install it globally first.

Install `pre-commit` (we recommend using [pipx](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/)):

```bash
# Install pipx following the link
pipx install pre-commit
```

With `pre-commit` installed, activate it as a pre-commit hook:

```bash
pre-commit install
```

To run the linting and formatting manually, enter the command below:

```bash
pre-commit run -a
```

**Now, you can only commit if all the pre-commit tests pass**.

## First time clone

1. Fork this repo
2. Clone your repo (this will create a `git remote` called `origin`)
3. Add this repo as a remote `git remote add orgremote https://github.com/JuliaSmoothOptimizers/JSOSolvers.jl`

## Working on a new issue

1. Fetch from the JSO remote and fast-forward your local main

   ```bash
   git fetch orgremote
   git switch main
   git merge --ff-only orgremote/main
   ```

2. Branch from `main` to address the issue (see below for naming)

   ```bash
   git switch -c 42-add-answer-universe
   ```

3. Push the new local branch to your personal remote repository

   ```bash
   git push -u origin 42-add-answer-universe
   ```

4. Create a pull request to merge your remote branch into the org main.

### Branch naming

- If there is an associated issue, add the issue number.
- If there is no associated issue, **and the changes are small**, add a prefix such as "typo", "hotfix", "small-refactor", according to the type of update.
- If the changes are not small and there is no associated issue, then create the issue first, so we can properly discuss the changes.
- Use dash separated imperative wording related to the issue (e.g., `14-add-tests`, `15-fix-model`, `16-remove-obsolete-files`).

### Commit message

- Use imperative, present tense (Add feature, Fix bug)
- Have informative titles
- If necessary, add a body with details

### Before creating a pull request

- [Advanced] Try to create "atomic git commits" (recommended reading: [The Utopic Git History](https://blog.esciencecenter.nl/the-utopic-git-history-d44b81c09593)).
- Make sure the tests pass.
- Make sure the pre-commit tests pass.
- Fetch any `main` updates from upstream and rebase your branch, if necessary:

   ```bash
   git fetch orgremote
   git rebase orgremote/main BRANCH_NAME
   ```

- Then you can open a pull request and work with the reviewer to address any issues
